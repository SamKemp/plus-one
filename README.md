## Plus One

Someone asked for a simple solution to replicate the behavior of Mineplex's player count. (`onlineCount + 1`) 
So I provided them with this.


It is compatible with both Bukkit/Spigot servers & BungeeCord.


## Usage
Just plop the binary into the proper folder:
- BungeeCord: `{root}/modules`
- Bukkit/Spigot: `{root}/plugins`
