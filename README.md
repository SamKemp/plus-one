## Plus One

Someone asked for a simple solution to replicate the behavior of Mineplex's player count. (`onlineCount + 1`) 


So, I provided them with this. It was built to be compatible with both Bukkit/Spigot servers & BungeeCord.


## Usage

Just plop the [binary](https://github.com/OutdatedVersion/plus-one/releases/download/1.0/Plus-One.jar) into the proper folder:

- BungeeCord: `{root}/modules`
- Bukkit/Spigot: `{root}/plugins`
